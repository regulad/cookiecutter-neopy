# cookiecutter-neopy

Hi there!
I'm an amateur Python developer, and I love [`tyrannosaurus`](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/tyrannosaurus), 
and equally love [`cookiecutter-hypermodern-python`](https://cookiecutter-hypermodern-python.readthedocs.io/en/2022.6.3.post1/).
However, in my extended use of both, I noticed some shortcomings that I wanted to address.

1. `tyrannosaurus` uses its own templating engine, but it unfortunately is very buggy and most of its exclusive features (like sync) are poorly implemented. I wanted to use `cookiecutter`'s templating engine, which is much more robust and well-maintained.
2. `tyrannosaurus` tries too hard to make testing into a monolith, which yields unintelligible test results. Even though I prefer tox over nox, I still chose to take `cookiecutter-hypermodern-python`'s approach of using nox, because it's much more flexible and easier to use.
3. `tyrannosaurus` never seems to update its dependencies, and it's stuck on Python 3.8. I wanted to use Python 3.11 **exclusively** to make use of the increased performance and syntax features, and I wanted to use the latest versions of all the dependencies.
4. `tyrannosaurus` has a lot of boilerplate code pre-included, mainly for capturing test data and retrieving assets. While this is a good idea. It doesn't help that half of it is wrong and fails its own type checks. ðŸ™ƒ The boilerplate I chose to implement in my template is a lot lighter and only supplies things that EVERY project uses.
5. `cookiecutter-hypermodern-python` is a great template, but it lacks the tooling for containerization and deployment with Docker like `tyrannosaurus` has. I wanted to add that to this template.
6. `cookiecutter-hypermodern-python` also favors lower-level libraries like click over higher-level libraries like typer. I wanted to use typer, because it's a great library that makes it easy to build CLI applications.

For all of these reasons, I decided to fork `cookiecutter-hypermodern-python` and make my own template, `cookiecutter-neopy`. I hope you enjoy it!

## TODO

- [x] Convert to Python 3.11
- [x] Update dependencies
- [x] Add settings.yml for GitHub Probot
- [x] Add `typer`
- [x] Add Dockerfile
- [x] Add docker-compose.yml
- [x] Add GitHub Actions for publishing Docker image
- [x] Write typer boilerplate & tests
- [x] Write asset & metadata boilerplate & tests

## Usage

```console
# install pip & pipx through your distribution's package manager
pipx install poetry
pipx inject poetry poetry-plugin-export

pipx install nox
pipx inject nox nox-poetry

pipx install cookiecutter

# confirm poetry can find both Python~3.11 and Python~3.12
pipx python list

cookiecutter gh:regulad/cookiecutter-neopy
```

Please note, you must have the following installed and on `PATH`: `nox`, `Python 3.11/3.12`, `poetry` & `git`

The following segment of the README is the original README from `cookiecutter-hypermodern-python`.

[Cookiecutter] template for a Python package based on the
[Hypermodern Python] article series.

âœ¨ðŸ“šâœ¨ [Read the full documentation][readthedocs page]

[cookiecutter]: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter
[hypermodern python]: https://medium.com/@cjolowicz/hypermodern-python-d44485d9d769

## Usage

```console
cookiecutter gh:cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python --checkout=2022.8.23
```

Special branches in the `frameworks` folder are available for some Python frameworks like FastAPI, Discord.py, and more. Check GitHub to see if there's a branch for your framework of choice.

These special templates also carry the opinionated nature of the base template, so you can expect the same quality of code and documentation.

```console
cookiecutter gh:cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python --checkout=frameworks/fastapi
```
